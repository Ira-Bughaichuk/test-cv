### About me
I am a diligent and organized frontend developer with a solid understanding of fundamental concepts and technical aspects of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, including Redux. My main goal is to enhance and apply my skills on real projects within a growing and friendly team.
In the past, I had the opportunity to fulfill the role of a Scrum Master in team projects, so I understand that a high level of collaboration and interaction is crucial for project success. I value learning opportunities and I am eager to learn from colleagues and improve my skills. 
I am an ambitious and persevering developer, and I look forward to connecting with the HR department or a recruiter if you are seeking someone like me.
